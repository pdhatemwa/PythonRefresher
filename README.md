# PythonRefresher

## Description

This repository has been created under the instruction of my lecturer as part of an academic exercise. It is intended to showcase my understanding and application of *basic Python syntax* through a set of six questions designed to test my programming aptitude.

## Contents

The repository contains Python scripts that provide solutions to six individual questions. Each script demonstrates the use of fundamental Python concepts such as:

- Variable assignment
- Arithmetic operations
- Control flow (if-else statements)
- Looping (while and for loops)
- Functions
- Input/output operations

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate proficiency in:

- Writing clean and functional Python code
- Applying problem-solving techniques using code
- Understanding and implementing foundational programming constructs

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the file of the specific question you'd like to review or run.
3. Run the Python script using any standard Python interpreter (Python 3.12 recommended).
